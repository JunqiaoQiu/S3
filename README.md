# Scalability-Sensitive Speculation framework for FSM parallelization

**S3** is a scalability-sensitive speculation framework for FSM parallelization.
For any given FSM, **S3** can automatically characterize its properties and analyze its scalability, hence guide speculative paralleilization towards the optimal performance more efficient use of computing resources. More details can be found in our paper.
